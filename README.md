A collection of translation files for BSL Shaders v8.0 and above.
This is the Simplidies Chinese fork maintained by NuageuxZ.

## Contribution
I'm always open for anyone's contribution on adding more translations for BSL Shaders, credits will be given.
- You can start by making a copy of the `en_US.lang` file.
- Rename the copied file based on your language's [locale code](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language).
- Translate everything after the equals sign of each line.
- Additional instructions will be available soon.
